## overview

When it comes to private events, it becomes a tedious process to have to verify each guest by reading through a list of names. So we provide a full-stack app solution, called **Gatekeeper**.

**Gatekeeper** enables users to manage who has access to their events by sending links where guests can accept their invite. Upon acceptance, a unique QR code is generated and emailed to the guest. Then, this QR code can then be validated using your device's own integrated camera in the web-app.

Overall, **Gatekeeper** makes for a simple, efficient, and reliable validation process.
