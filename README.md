## Overview

When it comes to private events, it becomes a tedious process to have to verify each guest by reading through a list of names. So we provide a full-stack app solution, called **Gatekeeper**.

**Gatekeeper** enables users to manage who is allowed into their private events by sending invitation links to authorized guests. Upon acceptance, a unique QR code is generated and sent to the guest. Then this QR code can be validated within our database by a Verifier, a system that can scan QR codes to check if the individual is authorized.

Overall, **Gatekeeper** makes for a simple, efficient, and reliable validation process.
